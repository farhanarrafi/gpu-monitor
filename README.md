## GPU Monitor

A minimalistic GPU resource monitor for our lab. 

The usecases can be very simple : to see which GPU is free or who is using a particular GPU, 
or more advanced : keeping tabs on a `process` which is running on a GPU. 

This project is in continuous development and more features will be added as needed.


*Note: This is a side project. Expect a few bugs here and there.
